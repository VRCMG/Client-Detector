# Client-Detector
Detects when someone is likely using a Modified Client in your lobby

# How does it work?
This is done by seeing if their FPS, ping, or whether their custom properties are all valid, if they are not then they will be detected.

*Keep in mind this is not a foolproof detection there are false positives, this usually happens when someone's ping is naturally above 1000 which is rare but it does happen to a few unfortunate individuals so if it says they are a client user and they are like a visitor or steam user just ignore it lol.*

# Updates
I plan on keeping this mod up to date for every future VRChat update, I also believe I will add more detections such as whether the user is flying, speedhacking, or sending too many events per recursion soon!
