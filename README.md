# Client-Detector
Detects when someone is likely using a Modified Client in your lobby

# How does it work?
This is done by seeing if their FPS, ping, and whether their custom properties are valid, if it's not then they will be detected.

*Keep in mind this is not a foolproof detection there are false positives, this usually happens when someone's ping is naturally above 1000 which is rare but it does happen to a few unfortunate individuals so if it says they are a client user and they are like a visitor or steam user just ignore it lol.*
